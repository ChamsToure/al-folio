# A basic neural network from scratch

## Description

The Architecture of the Neural Network is simple with 1 input layer 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer.
This program serves primarly as a learning project, to fully understand the fundamental parts and mechanics
of a simple Neural Network without any large frameworks. 

## Requirements
The only additional library you need is the **Eigen** library, for the computations.
For this project I use the Eigen 3.3.9 version. You can get it [here](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

## How to build

```
cd to <project-folder>
g++ main.cpp nnet.cpp -o main.exe
./main.exe
```
